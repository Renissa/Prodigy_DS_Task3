# Prodigy_DS_Task3
Problem Statement - Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine LearningÂ Repository.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this task is [bank-additional.csv](https://github.com/Renissa/Prodigy_DS_Task3/blob/823cc536baf40af290fc97ea2b3d1d1da1fc8597/bank-additional.csv)

# Conclusion
Task 3 deepened my expertise in creating decision tree classifiers for predictive modeling. I learned how demographic factors and behavioral data influence customer decisions. This insight enabled me to build models that predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service, based on these attributes.
